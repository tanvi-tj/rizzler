Every love song suddenly makes sense when I see you.
You're the reason the sun decides to shine each day.
"Hey, what’s your name? Or can I call you mine?"
You free later? My dog says we should hang out.
"You’re cute, can I keep you?"
You + me = instant vibes.
"Do you have a name, or can I call you ‘mine’ for now?"
Just seeing you makes my day better.
You're the sweetest part of my scroll today.
You make the ordinary feel extraordinary.
You're the reason I believe in good things.
You’re the kind of magic I didn’t know I needed.
"If I had a star for every time you brightened my day, I'd have a galaxy."
"You must be tired, because you've been running through my mind all day."
Do you have a map? Because I just got lost in your eyes.
Are you Wi-Fi? Because I'm feeling a strong connection.
"You're so hot, even my heart needs air conditioning."
Do you believe in love at first sight—or should I walk by again?
Are you French? Because Eiffel for you.
"If you were a vegetable, you’d be a cute-cumber."
Do you like raisins? How do you feel about a date?
"I’m not a photographer, but I can picture us together."
Are you made of copper and tellurium? Because you're Cu-Te.
Do you like science? Because I've got chemistry with you.
Are you a 45-degree angle? Because you’re acute-y.
"You must be an algorithm, because you’re solving all my problems."
Are you JavaScript? Because you’ve got my code running smooth.
"If kisses were snowflakes, I'd send you a blizzard."
"You're the poem I didn't know how to write, and this life is the story."
Even the moon envies your glow.

Just seeing you makes my day better.
You're the sweetest part of my scroll today.
You make the ordinary feel extraordinary.
You're the reason I believe in good things.
You’re the kind of magic I didn’t know I needed.
"If I had a star for every time you brightened my day, I'd have a galaxy."
"You must be tired, because you've been running through my mind all day."
Do you have a map? Because I just got lost in your eyes.
Are you Wi-Fi? Because I'm feeling a strong connection.
"You're so hot, even my heart needs air conditioning."
Do you believe in love at first sight—or should I walk by again?
Are you French? Because Eiffel for you.
"If you were a vegetable, you’d be a cute-cumber."
Do you like raisins? How do you feel about a date?
"I’m not a photographer, but I can picture us together."

Are you JavaScript? Because you’ve got my code running smooth.
"If kisses were snowflakes, I'd send you a blizzard."
"You're the poem I didn't know how to write, and this life is the story."
Even the moon envies your glow.
Every love song suddenly makes sense when I see you.
You're the reason the sun decides to shine each day.
"Hey, what’s your name? Or can I call you mine?"
You free later? My dog says we should hang out.
"You’re cute, can I keep you?"
You + me = instant vibes.

You’re the kind of magic I didn’t know I needed.
"If I had a star for every time you brightened my day, I'd have a galaxy."
"You must be tired, because you've been running through my mind all day."
Do you have a map? Because I just got lost in your eyes.
Are you Wi-Fi? Because I'm feeling a strong connection.
"You're so hot, even my heart needs air conditioning."
Do you believe in love at first sight—or should I walk by again?
Are you French? Because Eiffel for you.
"If you were a vegetable, you’d be a cute-cumber."
Do you like raisins? How do you feel about a date?
"I’m not a photographer, but I can picture us together."
Are you made of copper and tellurium? Because you're Cu-Te.
Do you like science? Because I've got chemistry with you.
Are you a 45-degree angle? Because you’re acute-y.
"You must be an algorithm, because you’re solving all my problems."
Are you JavaScript? Because you’ve got my code running smooth.
"If kisses were snowflakes, I'd send you a blizzard."
"You're the poem I didn't know how to write, and this life is the story."
Even the moon envies your glow.
Every love song suddenly makes sense when I see you.
You're the reason the sun decides to shine each day.
"Hey, what’s your name? Or can I call you mine?"
You free later? My dog says we should hang out.
"You’re cute, can I keep you?"
You + me = instant vibes.
"Do you have a name, or can I call you ‘mine’ for now?"
Just seeing you makes my day better.
You're the sweetest part of my scroll today.
You make the ordinary feel extraordinary.

"You're so hot, even my heart needs air conditioning."
Do you believe in love at first sight—or should I walk by again?
Are you French? Because Eiffel for you.
"If you were a vegetable, you’d be a cute-cumber."
Do you like raisins? How do you feel about a date?
"I’m not a photographer, but I can picture us together."
Are you made of copper and tellurium? Because you're Cu-Te.
Do you like science? Because I've got chemistry with you.
Are you a 45-degree angle? Because you’re acute-y.
"You must be an algorithm, because you’re solving all my problems."
Are you JavaScript? Because you’ve got my code running smooth.
"If kisses were snowflakes, I'd send you a blizzard."
"You're the poem I didn't know how to write, and this life is the story."
Even the moon envies your glow.
Every love song suddenly makes sense when I see you.
You're the reason the sun decides to shine each day.
"Hey, what’s your name? Or can I call you mine?"

"You’re cute, can I keep you?"
You + me = instant vibes.
"Do you have a name, or can I call you ‘mine’ for now?"
Just seeing you makes my day better.
You're the sweetest part of my scroll today.
You make the ordinary feel extraordinary.
You're the reason I believe in good things.
You’re the kind of magic I didn’t know I needed.
"If I had a star for every time you brightened my day, I'd have a galaxy."
"You must be tired, because you've been running through my mind all day."
Do you have a map? Because I just got lost in your eyes.
